Beginner/Fundamental Level:

What is Kubernetes and what are its core benefits?
Explain the concept of a Pod in Kubernetes. How are containers related to Pods?
What is a Node in Kubernetes? What are the key components running on a Node?
What is the Kubernetes Control Plane? Name some of its key components and their roles.
What is a Kubernetes Deployment? How does it help in managing applications?
Explain the purpose of a Kubernetes Service. What are the different types of Services?
What are Kubernetes Namespaces and why are they useful?
What is kubectl? Name a few commonly used kubectl commands.
What is a YAML manifest in Kubernetes? What are the essential fields in a Pod manifest?
What is the difference between kubectl apply and kubectl create?
Intermediate Level:

Explain the lifecycle of a Pod in Kubernetes. What are some common Pod states?
How do you perform a rolling update of an application in Kubernetes? What strategies are involved?
What are ReplicaSets and how are they related to Deployments?
Explain how networking works between Pods in a Kubernetes cluster. What is a CNI?
How do you expose an application running in Kubernetes to the outside world? Discuss different methods.
What are ConfigMaps and Secrets in Kubernetes? How are they used by applications?
Explain how Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) work in Kubernetes. Why are they important for stateful applications?
What are Kubernetes labels and selectors? How are they used to organize and select resources?
What are Kubernetes Annotations? How do they differ from Labels?
How can you monitor the health and performance of your Kubernetes cluster and applications?
Advanced Level:

Discuss different Container Network Interface (CNI) options for Kubernetes. What are the pros and cons of a couple of popular choices?
Explain the concept of Network Policies in Kubernetes. How can you implement network segmentation and security?
How does Kubernetes handle scheduling of Pods onto Nodes? What factors influence the scheduling decisions?
What are Taints and Tolerations in Kubernetes? How can you use them to control Pod scheduling on specific Nodes?
Explain the role of Admission Controllers in the Kubernetes API request lifecycle. Give some examples of built-in Admission Controllers.
Discuss different strategies for managing stateful applications in Kubernetes (e.g., using StatefulSets, Operators).
How can you implement autoscaling in Kubernetes? Explain both Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA).
What are Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and Operators in Kubernetes? How can they extend the functionality of the platform?
Discuss best practices for securing a Kubernetes cluster. Consider aspects like RBAC, network security, and Secrets management.
How would you troubleshoot a scenario where a Pod is stuck in the Pending state? What are the common reasons for this?
Troubleshooting & Scenario-Based Questions:

A Pod is failing to start and shows a CrashLoopBackOff status. How would you diagnose the issue? What steps would you take to resolve it?
Your application is experiencing intermittent network connectivity issues with another service within the same Kubernetes cluster. How would you troubleshoot this?
You need to upgrade the Kubernetes version of your cluster. What are the key considerations and steps involved in a safe upgrade process?
Your application is running out of memory. How would you monitor its resource usage and implement resource requests and limits in Kubernetes?
You need to implement a blue/green deployment strategy for your application in Kubernetes. How would you achieve this using Deployments and Services?
